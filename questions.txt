-> The proposed output streaming tree would be better over a full mesh-up since it reduces the upload bandwidth of all trees.
-> I am not sure if I could improve the input size by creating just one streaming tree?
	-> one thought would be to have a single bidirectional streaming tree, but this is just a big mesh

#####	
-> a different thought would be to have a round-robin system; where browsers maintain only 2 data streams: in/out
		** This would reduce the input to 1, and output to 1
		-> this could work with multiple tracks in the same MediaStream
		-> May have bi-directional streams (maintain 2 in/ 2 out) !! synchronization issues !!
		++ scales a lot better than other methods 
		-- more stream processing: need to append your own data to the input stream and handle multiple stream tracks
		-- more delay: n hops to recieve data (vs log(n) in case of the streaming tree)

** Note: main difference between chat and other streaming apps is the chat has multiple stream sources.
